# Tutorial: Rate Limiting app in NodeJS 

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend - NodeJS, ExpressJS, Redis

## How it works

This app has been build using `exoress-rate-limit` and `rate-limit-redis` library which will block connections from a client after surpassing certain amount of requests (default: 10) per time (default: 10 sec)

The application will return after each request the following headers. That will let the user know how many requests they have remaining before the run over the limit.

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 9
```

On the 10th run server should return an HTTP status code of **429 Too Many Requests**

### Available commands

```
"PEXPIRE", "MULTI", "DEL", "PTTL", "EXEC", "DECR", "INCR"
```

## Hot to run it locally?

### Prerequisites

-   Node - v12.19.0
-   NPM - v6.14.8
-   Docker - v19.03.13 (optional)

### Local installation

```
git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-redis-rate-limiting-demo-nodejs/

# copy file and set proper data inside
cp .env.example .env

# install dependencies
npm install

# run docker compose or install redis manually
docker network create global
docker-compose up -d --build

npm run dev

```

### Env variables:

-   PORT - port that server is listening on.
-   REDIS_HOST - host for redis instance. Can be with `redis://` or without.
-   REDIS_PORT - port for redis instance.
-   REDIS_PASSWORD - password for redis. Running redis by docker-compose, there's no password. Running by https://redislabs.com/try-free/ you have to pass this variable.
-   REDIS_ENDPOINT_URI - redis port and host encoded in redis uri take precedence over other environment variables. Can be with `redis://` or without.
-   COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME - only for docker-compose to set project name.

## Deployment

To make deploys work, you need to create free account in https://redislabs.com/try-free/ and get Redis' instance informations - REDIS_ENDPOINT_URI and REDIS_PASSWORD. You must pass them as environmental variables (in .env file or by server config, like `Heroku Config Variables`).
